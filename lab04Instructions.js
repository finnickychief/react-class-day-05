/*
Add some new pieces to our BookList application:

  Add a header/navbar with the following links:
    View Books
    Add Book

  Create a method that handles a route/view change for these 2 new buttons. You will need to setState on the route to handle this, and use a parameter into the function that lets the method know which one to set it to.

  Add a footer using a new component for our page. Put any information in it you deem necessary such as a copyright symbol or a link to your github
